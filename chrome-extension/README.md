CheckMarc: The team name Auto-Completer
=================

**CheckMarc is chrome extension built to fill boilerplate/repetitive text fields when completing FCR tickets in Service-Now.** It is a lot more general than a template but that attribute also makes it more *flexible*.

PRIMARY FUNCTIONS
-----------------

CheckMarc is built to abstract the semi-conscious procedure of:

1. typing/spelling what you want
2. double checking or correcting typing spelling mistakes until you get something with results
3. waiting on the data to load
4. selecting what you want

is a waste of mental processing, *and* is mistake-prone. The goal of this project is to turn that act into a series of keystrokes *( a la perennial favorite Ctrl-Alt-Del )*. Ideally, it would fill in everything that is normally repetitively typed/selected.

**Guiding Values**

- Simplicity and Conciseness are key
- Privacy and Confidentiality are required
- Efficiency is paramount


CURRENT STATE
---

Checkmarc is currently in final testing and packaging for a consumer release.

Bug-fix and feature-add will now be performed on a crowd-effort, rolling basis; there are other branches set up for these development phases.

Guide
======
This section details installation, configuration, and usage.

INSTALLATION
-----

1. lather
2. rinse
3. repeat

**Configuration**
In its current state, CheckMarc currently requires no user configuration.
*Keyboard combination options may be added in the near future.*

USAGE
-----

Press keyboard press when in box; press 's' so the function runs; depending on the number of recent teams, you may be able to hit 'Tab'. Else, you will have to click the name desired.
*(I believe this is in relation to the 'recents' anyway - but this is not confirmed)*

FAQ
=====

**1. Can you add {feature}?**

I would absolutely consider it. Let's talk about what it is and
how it would work, and then we'll get cracking!

**2. Can I Help?**

That would be awesome! All project files are hosted on this GitHub Repo. Feel free to download and change as you see fit. Please 'fork' to your own branch/project if you do this and you can have version control.

**3. Does it do your name in 'assigned'?**

Not currently, there is a synchronous function on assignment_group that really messes with my attempts to do so.
